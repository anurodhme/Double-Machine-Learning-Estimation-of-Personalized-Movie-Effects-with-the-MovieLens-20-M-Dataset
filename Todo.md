# Statistics Project To-Do List

This to-do list outlines the key phases and tasks for completing the statistics project. Each section includes a checklist to track progress.

---

### Phase 0: Repository & Environment Setup

*   [x] **Initialize Git Repository:** Set up version control for the project.
*   [x] **Create Project Structure:** Set up directories for data, scripts, and outputs.
*   [x] **Environment Setup:** Create a Python environment with required packages (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn).
*   [x] **Requirements File:** Create requirements.txt or environment.yml for reproducibility.

### Phase 1: Data Acquisition

*   [ ] **Finalize Dataset:** Confirm the primary dataset for the analysis.
*   [ ] **Download Data:** [Dataset Link (one-click download)]('https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset/')
*   [ ] **Create Data Dictionary:** Document each variable, its type (e.g., numeric, categorical), and a brief description.
*   [ ] **Store Raw Data:** Save the original, unaltered dataset in a dedicated `data/raw/` directory.

---

### Phase 2: Data Preparation & Cleaning

*   [ ] **Load Data:** Write a script to load the dataset into your analysis environment (e.g., R, Python).
*   [ ] **Handle Missing Values:** Identify and decide on a strategy for missing data (e.g., imputation, removal).
*   [ ] **Correct Errors:** Check for and correct any data entry errors or inconsistencies.
*   [ ] **Transform Variables:** Create new variables or transform existing ones as needed for analysis (e.g., log transformation).
*   [ ] **Save Cleaned Data:** Store the cleaned dataset in a `data/processed/` directory to separate it from the raw data.

### Phase 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

*   [ ] **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculate summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) for key variables.
*   [ ] **Data Visualization:** Create visualizations to understand data distributions and relationships:
    *   [ ] Histograms or density plots for numeric variables.
    *   [ ] Bar charts for categorical variables.
    *   [ ] Scatter plots for relationships between numeric variables.
    *   [ ] Box plots to compare distributions.
*   [ ] **Identify Outliers:** Investigate any unusual data points or potential outliers.
*   [ ] **Formulate Hypotheses:** Based on the EDA, develop initial hypotheses to test.

---

### Phase 4: Modeling & Analysis

*   [ ] **Select Appropriate Models:** Choose statistical models that align with your research questions and data types.
*   [ ] **Implement Models:** Write code to fit the selected models to the data.
*   [ ] **Check Model Assumptions:** Validate that the assumptions of your chosen models are met.
*   [ ] **Interpret Results:** Analyze the model outputs, including coefficients, p-values, and confidence intervals.
*   [ ] **Run Sensitivity Analysis:** Test how robust your findings are to different assumptions or model specifications.

---

### Phase 5: Reporting

*   [ ] **Structure the Report:** Outline the sections of your final report (e.g., Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion).
*   [ ] **Draft the Report:** Write the full analysis, explaining your methodology and findings.
*   [ ] **Create Final Visualizations:** Generate high-quality plots and tables to include in the report.
*   [ ] **Review and Edit:** Proofread the report for clarity, accuracy, and grammatical errors.
*   [ ] **Finalize Code and Documentation:** Clean up your analysis scripts and ensure they are well-commented and reproducible.
